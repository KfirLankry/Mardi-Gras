            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for
            about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
            tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
            most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
            Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
            (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are
            organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same
            parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes
            were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of
            Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are
            well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe
            of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known
            for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social
            Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American krewe. Float
            riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
            throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated
            plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major
            krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year. While
            many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
            Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts
            and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
            upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably
            the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
            Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi
            Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting
            of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

            LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
            politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, a post
            she has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first
            woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented
            District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018. Cantrell
            was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the
            position in the city's history. Once in office, she established a
            new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
            strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell
            also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding
            solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel
            taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused
            on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
            transportation, public parks, and green spaces.[30] As part of that
            initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
            against four opioid manufacturers and distributors. During the 2019
            session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair
            Share Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and
            tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront
            funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million
            in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of
            the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4
            proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in
            the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale
            and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the establishment
            of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
