                Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
                claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do
                not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual
                parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official
                organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day
                (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday
                is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</div>

                morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat
                dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want
                to bring a raincoat!</div>

                Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer
                than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days to experience Mardi Gras.
                Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all

              <div class="accordion-body text_align font_size grey_color">Even
                though every parade is unique, Orpheus, Bacchus, and Endymion feature the most intricate, massive, and
                extravagant floats.

                According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official definition for "super Krewe,” it is generally
                accepted that a super krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and maintains at least 500
                riders for its parade each carnival.” Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we think there’s a little more to
                it than that.

                Along with a large membership, super krewes have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much
                sought-after signature throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known for their big before and
                after-parade celebrations with big-name talent (i.e., the Bacchus Bash, the Endymion Extravaganza, and
                the Orpheuscapade).

                The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a super
                krewe in 1974. Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe status. Three all-female super krewes
                also take to the parade route, including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx. With 1,600+ active
                riders, the Krewe of Iris, established in 1917, is not only the largest female Mardi Gras krewe, but it
                is also the oldest.

              <div class="accordion-body text_align font_size grey_color">By all
                means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew up
                in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade because
                we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold
                all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since
                parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is
                a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having
                picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the
                streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which is
                only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend,
                is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</div>

                Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the Sunday closest to
                St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner-city
                neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle
                and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet
                at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade.

                The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of March,
                around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle
                Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take to the
                streets to meet other "gangs."

                For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

                Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the Sunday
                closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been
                yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend between French
                Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on these events at this time.</div>
